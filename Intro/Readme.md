# Questions:

1. #####What are the three most essential skills that a beginner programmer 
##### needs to know?
  * Reading and writing
  * Attention to detail
  * Spotting the differences

2. #####Please explain these three skills in your own words.
    
    The reading and writing skill is comparable to learning a new language,
    and practicing that language with immersion is key.
    
    Attention to detail is making sure the code you are typing is
    exactly what you want it to be, and double checking the syntax,
    spelling, order etc.
    
    Spotting the differences is learned primarily over time, but it is
    being able to compare two sections of code and see how one was
    changed, it is important for diagnostics and bug fixes.
    
3. #####Why do you need to not copy and paste?
    
    Typing is a way to not just visually understand the code, but practice
    it with your hands and eyes. Watching a video on how to juggle is
    not the same as trying and failing 10 times.

4. #####Why is Practice and Persistence important?
    
    It is going to be frustrating at first, and everyone feels like they
    don't understand it. If one is to be a programmer however, pushing 
    through the difficulty is very important, and eventually the "Ah ha!"
    moment will come.
